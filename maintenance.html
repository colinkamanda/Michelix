            <p> When looking to improve your computer's perfomance, a commonly overlooked factor
                is computer Hardware maintenance. Most people purchase new parts or even buy a brand-new 
                device whenever they encounter computer errors and faulty computer Hardware components.
                There are basic actions you can take to improve your computer's perfomance immediately.
                <br>
                PC hardware maintenance is the process of auditing, upgrading, and maintening a computer's 
                physical parts to ensure the components perform optimally. IT hardware maintenance involves 
                caring for components such as the Keyboard, CD drives, hard disk, batttery, and other peripherals.

            from your Keyboard and mouse. Ensure the mouse works consistenly and make replacements
            where necessary.
